## Task Description
Your task for this challenge is to create a small todo app 

A todo is a task yet to be done; an item on a to-do list.
A todo must have these properties
- id
- title
- description
- created time
- is done

## Requirements
The basic todo app should be capable these following operations.

1. The app should be able to display the list to todo
2. The app should be able to create a new todo
3. The app should be able to update information of a todo
4. The app should be able to delete a todo

### User Interface
The user interface should be a browser-based application developed using your JavaScript web framework of choice. It should support the three aforementioned operations. How this is done is completely up to you. Use your creativity and imagination to create a UI that will set your submission apart!

### REST API (OPTIONAL)
This part is optional you, but will be considered bonus points if you provide them.
The REST API can be implemented using whatever language and frameworks of your choosing. Again, like the UI, it needs to support the three operations listed above. How you choose to accomplish this task is up to you.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
